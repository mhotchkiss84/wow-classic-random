# wow-classic-random
# This is project for randomizing a character using user selected parameters. This is a smaller project that I am going to use in a bigger one in a few months.
# Initially this project was a form with selections. I have since decided to go a different direction using images and click events

# To Do:
# Finishing making code modular
# Add option to save output to json database
# Allow user to edit the saved output
# Change from form to interactive interface. i.e. images of faction & random show up and user clicks on one to set. Also have a start button.
# Have javascript output to HTML for the selections instead of having a form or anything inside the HTML
# Complete rework of CSS
# Find out how to add styling to readme to make it easier to read

# To Use:
# Currently due to redoing a lot of code this project is broken. I should have the main functionality back in the next day or two.
# Clone the repo
# The database .json file does nothing currently so no need to run a JSON server
# If using gitbash open with your code editor and run live server
# Expected output: Not much right now since its broken from decided to redo everything.
